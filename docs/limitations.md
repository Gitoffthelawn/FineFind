# Limitations

## Chrome Incompatibility

**In short**: Google Chrome/Chromium is currently incompatible with the method FineFind uses to determine the position of a search result.

**Detailed technical explanation**:
After FineFind detects that a new result has been found using the selectionchange event, it attempts to determine the position of the result. To achieve this, FineFind utilizes `window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0)`.
This is where the issue arises. Mozilla Firefox treats Find in Page (CTRL+F) results as a standard text selection, which allows `getRangeAt(0)` to return a valid range object. In contrast, Chrome/Chromium's Find in Page implementation uses a pseudo-selection that is not exposed as a normal selection.
As a result, calling `window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0)` in Chrome/Chromium throws an `Uncaught IndexSizeError: Failed to execute 'getRangeAt' on 'Selection': 0 is not a valid index` error.
Due to this behavior, there is currently no way to determine the exact position of a search result in Chrome/Chromium. Consequently, FineFind is unable to display the in-page indicator for search results in these browsers.

## Textarea and Input Limitations

**In short**: FineFind does not work inside `<textarea>` or `<input>` elements in most cases, due to how their content is handled by browsers.

**Detailed technical explanation**:
The text content within a `<textarea>` or `<input>` is not rendered as regular DOM text nodes. Instead, it is part of the element's internal value and not part of the documentâ€™s actual DOM structure (at least according to my research). This means that FineFind cannot access the individual characters or their positions using standard DOM methods like `window.getSelection()`.

As a result, FineFind is unable to detect the position of a search result within these elements, preventing it from displaying its indicator.

In some cases, highlighting inside `<input>` fields appears to work. However, this behavior is not consistent and may vary depending on the browser or specific conditions.

For now, FineFind does not support highlighting search results inside `<textarea>` and `<input>` fields reliably. This is a technical limitation inherent to how browsers handle form element content.
