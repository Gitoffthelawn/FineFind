  FineFind
</h1>
<p align="center">🛠 This WebExtension is currently in beta 🛠</p>
Enhances your browser with an animation that makes Ctrl + F results more noticeable!

## Compatibility

#### 🦊🔥 ✔

This extension is currently compatible with Firefox only. Some Firefox-based browsers, such as LibreWolf, should also be compatible, though their functionality cannot be guaranteed as they are not actively tested.

#### 🌐 ❌

Chrome and Chrome-based browsers are currently incompatible with the method FineFind uses to detect search results. If you discover a workaround, we encourage you to share it with us.

## How to use

To use FineFind, simply open your browsers native in-page search (Ctrl + F). FineFind will integrate seamlessly, displaying an indicator as you navigate through search results.

You can further customize your experience via the FineFind options page.

## Contribution

Your feedback is invaluable, especially for a project like FineFind, which is still in its early development. Detailed reports on bugs and feature suggestions are crucial for its improvement.

Please submit any issues or feature requests through the projects issue tracker.
( If you prefer to communicate privately, you can reach out via direct message on Nexus Mods 😉 )

## Credits
I am delighted that some people helped me with the translation to make the extension understandable for everyone. I would like to thank [NikoTheFox](https://github.com/RandomWolf) (English) and [Vinicius Vechio Berger](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Vechio/about-me) (Portuguese).
