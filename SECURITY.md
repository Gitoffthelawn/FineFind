# Security Policy

> [!WARNING]
> Do not disclose any security-related issues, especially not on the issue tracker! Use [this form](https://github.com/leonsdepot/FineFind/security/advisories/new) instead!

## Supported Versions

**Only the latest released stable version** receives security-related patches.

# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability in FineFind—for example, behavior that could be exploited to run arbitrary scripts, bypass user consent, or access sensitive data—please report it immediately through [this private advisory channel](https://github.com/leonsdepot/FineFind/security/advisories/new)!

> [!WARNING]
> Do not share details of the issue publicly or with anyone else until a fix has been released. Early disclosure may put users at risk by allowing attackers to exploit the issue before we have a chance to resolve it.

Keeping the report private gives us the time we need to investigate and release a patch. Once the fix is publicly available, you’re welcome to share details of the issue responsibly.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you come across a security concern that someone has accidentally made public (e.g. as a regular issue on GitHub), please notify us immediately through the link above so we can address it appropriately and limit exposure.
